## Tool 1: Encryption Manager
- Used for **Yo-kai Watch 1**, **Yo-kai Watch 2**, **Yo-kai Watch Blasters**.

### Dependencies:
- **SJCL** - Stanford Javascript Crypto Library. The Lib *is* included with the appropriate license - props to them (I originally handled AES-CCM myself but I couldn't guarantee there would be no implementation bugs).
